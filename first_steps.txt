Hello there.

Now, first things first.

Install MongdoDB server (community edition). ✔🟫🟪❌

Make sure it is running.

Then for this code, run the initAdmin.js file first ("node initAdmin.js"). This is to initialize an administrator for the website.
If you have done this, skip this step.

Go now instead to the server.js file ("node server.js"). You can also run with "nodemon" instead of "node". 
We are still developing the site.
We haven't even finished dealing with the functionality, and we are still working on understanding how the backend works 😅.
So let's take this step by step.

ONGOING TASKS:
Initialize administator user.
Initialize server.js without problems.
Now the code:
Administrator side first
Managing book content in the site settings.
Find a way to add .doc files that will be rendered for viewing
Adding email functionality in case of "forgot password"

Client side next
List of books page (try working with 3 or 4 or more to understanding its functionality).
Chapter list of each book.
Chapter viewing content page. Enable support for bold and italics reading.
Manage the navigation buttons at the bottom.
Later check on adding ads to the site.
